Relationship Handling in Serializers:
--------------------------------------
- The Author and Book models have a one-to-many relationship
  (one Author can have multiple Books).
- The 'author' ForeignKey in the Book model uses related_name='books', allowing
  reverse lookups: author.books.all()
- In AuthorSerializer, we use the nested BookSerializer with many=True
  to serialize all related books for an author.
- Nested serialization here is read-only, meaning books are created/updated
  through the BookSerializer directly, not via the Author endpoint.
- Validation methods in both serializers leverage serializers.ValidationError
  to enforce data integrity rules before saving to the database.
